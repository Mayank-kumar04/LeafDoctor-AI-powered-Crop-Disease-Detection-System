1. **Login** - Use `crop`/`crop` or create a new account
2. **Upload Image** - Go to "Predict" page and upload crop leaf image
3. **View Results** - Get disease prediction with details
4. **Text-to-Speech** - Click speaker button to listen
5. **Translate** - Select language (Hindi/Bengali/Marathi/Bhojpuri) and translate

---

## 🌱 Supported Crops

- **Tomato** (9 diseases)
- **Potato** (3 diseases)
- **Bell Pepper** (2 diseases)

---

## 🔄 Stop Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal

To deactivate virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
---

## 🚧 Deployment Limitation

The project is deployed on Render using the free tier.

Due to limited RAM and storage:
- The deep learning model (.h5 / .pkl) cannot be fully loaded
- Live image prediction is not supported on the deployed version

✅ The application works correctly in the local environment,  
which is demonstrated in the provided demo video.
